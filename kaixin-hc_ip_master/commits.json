It also follows SLAP\nprinciples.\n\nThis commit extracts out each command into it\u0027s own command under an abstract command class, and\nmodifies the main code to use this abstracted form. It also removes unused code blocks and further\ngroups methods which require communication with the user into the Ui class.\n\nIt also makes the commands case insensitive, for the user\u0027s convenience.\n","tags":["A-MoreOOP","A-FullCommitMessage"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":567,"deletions":167}}},{"hash":"a0cfd7dd97a9324fc3c4a978af56646556d63aa2","messageTitle":"Add Junit Tests for TaskList (WIP)","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Jar","A-JUnit"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":12,"deletions":5},"java":{"insertions":148,"deletions":3}}},{"hash":"e6966765b75550d27a5903772eefc3de64075d5d","messageTitle":"Chore: Fix shadowjar config, add javadocs","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":1,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":31,"deletions":10}}}]},{"date":"2021-09-16","commitResults":[{"hash":"7a2c02f85f4053cf3cc9f480fb0d1a434fa9aeef","messageTitle":"Docs: Add javadoc comments to many public methods","messageBody":"","tags":["A-JavaDoc"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":98,"deletions":8}}},{"hash":"c70687e194cb0fc65b9a49bc7cd1b810a5ef1235","messageTitle":"Feat: Add the find command","messageBody":"When the user enters many tasks, it may be difficult to find the one you are looking for.\n\nUsing the find command allows users to find tasks more easily.\n\nIn the future, we might look at sorting tasks when they are returned, so that it is organised\nmore neatly and tasks can be even easier to find.\n","tags":["Level-9"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":68,"deletions":10}}},{"hash":"be17653a22ac552b57f8d149eb98d708cfe9f8c2","messageTitle":"Update README.md","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"md":{"insertions":28,"deletions":11}}}]},{"date":"2021-09-17","commitResults":[{"hash":"1f5caef65b35b0844137461bf7a4c98ea7737845","messageTitle":"Implement checkstyle to help check coding standard.","messageBody":"chore: fix coding standard errors as well.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":59,"deletions":51}}}]},{"date":"2021-09-18","commitResults":[{"hash":"40cab0e12051a55e6c6d3a5f9d76a35b0d275b0a","messageTitle":"Install JavaFX library","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":15,"deletions":3},"java":{"insertions":33,"deletions":6}}},{"hash":"04c952607f650bf661eca56d242949d5b7b4b266","messageTitle":"Complete JavaFX tutorial (refactor to use .fxml files)","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"fxml":{"insertions":38,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":195,"deletions":39}}}]},{"date":"2021-09-19","commitResults":[{"hash":"c0ea3b0c3e46d192771a3ceab29039255c270571","messageTitle":"Incorporate Katheryne logic","messageBody":"This commmit adds in the logic which was present in the CLI but not the GUI,\nsuch as parsing the commands and printing out visually responses.
