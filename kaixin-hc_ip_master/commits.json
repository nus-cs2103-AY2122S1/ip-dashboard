The process to parse these commands are similar, with certain differences.\n\nSeparating these out into different classes, and putting all of the parsing code into it\u0027s own\nclass, increases the readability and the abstraction of the code. It also follows SLAP\nprinciples.\n\nThis commit extracts out each command into it\u0027s own command under an abstract command class, and\nmodifies the main code to use this abstracted form. It also removes unused code blocks and further\ngroups methods which require communication with the user into the Ui class.\n\nIt also makes the commands case insensitive, for the user\u0027s convenience.\n","tags":["A-MoreOOP","A-FullCommitMessage"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":567,"deletions":167}}},{"hash":"a0cfd7dd97a9324fc3c4a978af56646556d63aa2","messageTitle":"Add Junit Tests for TaskList (WIP)","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Jar","A-JUnit"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":12,"deletions":5},"java":{"insertions":148,"deletions":3}}},{"hash":"e6966765b75550d27a5903772eefc3de64075d5d","messageTitle":"Chore: Fix shadowjar config, add javadocs","messageBody":"","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"gradle":{"insertions":1,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":31,"deletions":10}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"kaixin-hc":{"java":1029,"md":0,"fxml":0,"sh":4,"bat":2,"gradle":20,"txt":17}},"authorContributionVariance":{"kaixin-hc":26980.99},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"kaixin-hc":"CS2103T-W08-1 HANN..
